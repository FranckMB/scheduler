"""TDD test for BUG-4: two-pass solver fallback silently drops rest-day constraint.

When ``build_schedule`` cannot find a feasible solution with all HARD constraints
(Pass 1), it currently retries without the coach rest-day and salarie distribution
constraints (Pass 2).  This test ensures that either:

* the solver returns ``status="failed"`` (constraints are genuinely impossible), or
* the solver returns ``status="completed"`` **and** Enzo has at least 1 rest day
  among Mon-Fri (days 1-5).

Before the fix, Pass 2 silently drops the rest-day constraint and returns
``status="completed"`` with Enzo coaching on all 5 weekdays — the test fails.
After the fix, only one pass runs with all HARD constraints; INFEASIBLE is
surfaced as ``status="failed"``.
