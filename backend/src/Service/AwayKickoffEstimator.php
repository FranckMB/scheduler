 * THE rule « which kickoff does an hour-less AWAY fixture borrow » (P1-4 PR C),
 * extracted (PR D) because it now has TWO consumers — the conflict radar and
 * the match-placement payload — and two copies of an estimation rule
 * inevitably diverge (§7.2.1).
 *
 * An AWAY fixture without a real hour borrows its team's HABITUAL kickoff when
 * a habit exists on the match's weekday; otherwise it stays footprint-less
 * (the residual blind spot, named in PR E's graded diagnostic). A real hour is
 * never overridden; unplaced HOME fixtures are never estimated.
