/**
 * A10 (DoS "generation bomb" guard): before a generation is queued, bound the size of
 * the club/season problem so a mid-size-but-explosive payload can never monopolise the
 * club's single generation slot for the whole solver timeout. Caps are generous (~10x a
 * large FFBB club) — they trip only on a genuine bomb. Counts are aligned with what the
 * engine payload actually carries (`ScheduleConstraintBuilder`): constraints are counted
 * PERMANENT-only (calendarEntryId IS NULL — the base-plan set), never the dated overlay
 * rows the solver never receives.
 *
 * Dimensions the engine also bounds (slot_templates, priority_tiers, per-team tags) are
 * left to the engine's `max_length`: those reject INSTANTLY at Pydantic validation (before
 * any solve, so the generation lock is released in milliseconds — not a DoS), and adding
 * raw-row counts for them here would risk falsely blocking legitimate clubs.
