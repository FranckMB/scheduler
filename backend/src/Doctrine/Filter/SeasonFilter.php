/**
 * Doctrine SQL filter that scopes reads to the resolved season by appending
 * `season_id = ?` to every query on entities that own a `season_id` column.
 *
 * Same fail-secure, column-based idiom as TenantFilter: entities without a
 * season_id column (Season itself, Club, ClubUser, TeamTag, SportCategory…)
 * are untouched, so seasons stay listable for the season selector. As a
 * bonus this also bounds TeamTagAssignment (season_id, no club_id), which
 * the tenant filter cannot see.
 *
 * Season isolation is an intra-club correctness boundary (a rolled-over club
 * must never mix N-1/N/N+1 rows), not the security tenant boundary — that one
 * stays club_id (TenantFilter + RLS). The filter is activated per-request by
 * TenantFilterListener, only when a season resolves.
